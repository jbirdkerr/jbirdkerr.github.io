# 🔄 Metrics Pipeline & Sequence Flows

This document details the sequence flows for event capture, parallel persistence, and live dashboard rendering in **jbirdkerr.net**.

## 1. Event Capture & Dual Ingestion Pipeline

When a user interacts with the canvas (boops the snoot, rolls the eyes, engages party mode, or showers treats), events are captured and written to both PostHog and Supabase in parallel.

    autonumber
    actor User as 👤 Visitor
    participant Browser as 🌐 Browser (js/main.js)
    participant Worker as ☁️ Cloudflare Worker
    participant PostHog as 📊 PostHog Cloud
    participant Supabase as ⚡ Supabase (PostgreSQL)

    User->>Browser: Boops Snoot / Triggers Action
    Note over Browser: Plays WebAudio SFX & Spawns Particles (0ms)
    Browser->>Browser: PostHog SDK buffers & batches payload
    Browser->>Worker: POST /i/v0/e/ (JSON or gzip/base64 payload)
    
    par Forward to PostHog
        Worker->>PostHog: POST https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v0/e/
        PostHog-->>Worker: 200 OK
    and Persist to Supabase (Background)
        Worker->>Worker: Decode & normalize payload (JSON/Gzip/Base64)
        Worker->>Supabase: POST /rest/v1/rpc/record_site_events
        Note over Supabase: Atomic transaction updates:<br/>1. public.site_events (insert log)<br/>2. public.site_event_counts (upsert count)<br/>3. public.site_metrics (increment totals & combos)
        Supabase-->>Worker: 200 OK (Updated metrics JSON)
    end
    
    Worker-->>Browser: 200 OK
```

### Detailed Pipeline Stages

1. **Immediate Feedback (0ms Latency)**: Audio synthesis and particle effects trigger instantly on the client thread without waiting on network I/O.
2. **Batching & Compression**: PostHog's JS SDK buffers interactions and sends them via `POST /i/v0/e/` or `/batch`, encoded as raw JSON or gzipped base64 strings.
3. **Edge Forking**:
   - The Cloudflare Python Worker immediately proxies the untouched payload to PostHog Ingestion (`us.i.posthog.com`).
   - Concurrently, inside an async background task (`ctx.waitUntil`), the worker decodes the payload, extracts custom metrics (e.g. boops, eye roll distance in px, treat counts), and dispatches them to Supabase.
4. **Atomic Transaction in Supabase**:
   - `record_site_events(p_events)` runs as a single PostgreSQL transaction.
   - Inserts raw events into `public.site_events`.
   - Upserts aggregated totals into `public.site_event_counts`.
   - Updates global counters in `public.site_metrics`.

## 2. Live Dashboard Rendering Flow

When the metrics modal is opened, HTMX queries the Cloudflare Worker which retrieves the latest metrics from Supabase:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User as 👤 Visitor
    participant Modal as 📊 Metrics Modal (HTMX)
    participant Cache as ⚡ Edge Cache
    participant Worker as ☁️ Worker (/metrics)
    participant DB as ⚡ Supabase Tables

    User->>Modal: Clicks "📊 Metrics" or presses [M]
    Note over Modal: Immediately flushes pending eye distance
    Modal->>Cache: GET https://metrics-api.jbirdkerr.net/metrics
    
    alt Cache Hit (within 3 seconds)
        Cache-->>Modal: Return cached HTML response
    else Cache Miss
        Cache->>Worker: Invoke handle_metrics()
        par Query Summary & Events
            Worker->>DB: GET /rest/v1/site_metrics?select=*
            DB-->>Worker: Summary row JSON
        and Query Event Breakdown
            Worker->>DB: GET /rest/v1/site_event_counts?order=count.desc&limit=30
            DB-->>Worker: Event counts JSON
        end
        Worker->>Worker: Filter out internal ($*) events & render HTML
        Worker-->>Cache: HTML response (Cache-Control: s-maxage=3)
        Cache-->>Modal: Swaps HTML into #metrics-container
    end

    Note over Modal: JavaScript converts UTC timestamp to visitor's local timezone
```

### Key Performance & Caching Features

- **Pending Queue Flush**: Clicking "📊 Metrics" triggers a flush of any in-flight eye movement distance before querying the stats, ensuring immediate accuracy.
- **Edge Cache TTL**: Cached for 3 seconds (`s-maxage=3`) on Cloudflare's edge network, shielding the database from heavy concurrent polling while keeping stats virtually real-time.
- **Server-Side HTML Rendering**: The worker compiles the HTML directly using semantic Tailwind/retro-styled markup and emits UTC ISO timestamps (`data-utc`).
- **Client-Side Local Timezone Translation**: A tiny inline script parses `data-utc` elements to display "Last updated" timestamps in the visitor's local time format.
